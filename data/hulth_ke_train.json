However, the lack of language features for exploiting data locality often results in poor performance since the non-uniform memory access times on scalable SMP machines cannot be neglected. High Performance Fortran (HPF), the de-facto standard for data parallel programming, offers a rich set of data distribution directives in order to exploit data locality, but it has been mainly targeted towards distributed memory machines. In this paper we describe an optimized execution model for HPF programs on SMP machines that avails itself with mechanisms provided by OpenMP for work sharing and thread parallelism, while exploiting data locality based on user-specified distribution directives. Data locality does not only ensure that most memory accesses are close to the executing threads and are therefore faster, but it also minimizes synchronization overheads, especially in the case of unstructured reductions. The proposed shared memory execution model for HPF relies on a small set of language extensions, which resemble the OpenMP work-sharing features.

Spatial resolution is determined primarily by the projection readout resolution and is thus isotropic across the FOV, which is also isotropic.

Depending on different weight parameters w, the scaling functions and wavelets generated by the four-point subdivision scheme are of different degrees of smoothness. Therefore the user can select better wavelets relevant to the practice among the classes of wavelets. The authors apply the four-point wavelets in signal compression. The results show that the four-point wavelets behave much better than B-spline wavelets in many situations", "keywords": ["four-point wavelets", "image compression", "physical simulation", "numerical analysis", "interpolatory four-point subdivision scheme", "linear time complexity", "weight parameters", "scaling functions", "B-spline wavelets"]}, "631": {"keywords": ["interval estimation", "logistic dose-response curve", "asymptotic variance", "maximum likelihood estimator", "delta interval", "Fieller's theorem", "median effective dose"], "abstract": "Interval estimation of the gamma % effective dose ( mu /sub gamma / say) is often based on the asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimator (delta interval) or Fieller's theorem (Fieller interval).

Three clinical patients with CNS tumors were planned with two different MLC leaf sizes, 5 and 10 mm, representing Varian-120 and Varian-80 Millennium multileaf collimators, respectively. Two sets of IMRT treatment plans were developed. The goal of the first set was radiation dose conformality in three dimensions. The goal for the second set was organ avoidance of a nearby critical structure while maintaining adequate coverage of the target volume. Treatment planning utilized the CadPlan/Helios system (Varian Medical Systems, Milpitas CA) for dynamic MLC treatment delivery. All beam parameters and optimization (cost function) parameters were identical for the 5 and 10 mm plans. For all cases the number of beams, gantry positions, and table positions were taken from clinically treated three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy plans. Conformality was measured by the ratio of the planning isodose volume to the target volume. Organ avoidance was measured by the volume of the critical structure receiving greater than 90% of the prescription dose (V/sub 90/). For three patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (T2-T4 N0-N2c M0) 5 and 10 mm leaf widths were compared for parotid preservation utilizing nine coplanar equally spaced beams delivering a simultaneous integrated boost. Because modest differences in physical dose to the parotid were detected, a NTCP model based upon the clinical parameters of Eisbruch et al. was then used for comparisons. The conformality improved in all three CNS cases for the 5 mm plans compared to the 10 mm plans. For the organ avoidance plans, V/sub 90/ also improved in two of the three cases when the 5 mm leaf width was utilized for IMRT treatment delivery. In the third case, both the 5 and 10 mm plans were able to spare the critical structure with none of the structure receiving more than 90% of the prescription dose, but in the moderate dose range, less dose was delivered to the critical structure with the 5 mm plan. For the head and neck cases both the 5 and 10*2.5 mm beamlets dMLC sliding window techniques spared the contralateral parotid gland while maintaining target volume coverage. The mean parotid dose was modestly lower with the smaller beamlet size (21.04 Gy vs 22.36 Gy). The resulting average NTCP values were 13.72% for 10 mm dMLC and 8.24% for 5 mm dMLC. In conclusion, five mm leaf width results in an improvement in physical dose distribution over 10 mm leaf width that may be clinically relevant in some cases.

No other explicit input signal is required. Once the PID controller is tuned for a particular operating point, the relay may be disabled and chattering ceases correspondingly. However, it is invoked when there is a change in setpoint to another operating regime.

Parameter-dependent systems are linear systems, whose state-space descriptions are known functions of time-varying parameters.

The first method is based on linear fractional transformations which relies on the small gain theorem for bounds on performance and robustness. The other methods make use of either a single (SQLF) or parameter-dependent (PDQLF) quadratic Lyapunov function to bound the achievable level of performance. The latter two techniques are used to synthesize controllers for a high-performance turbofan engine.

All our thinning strategies remove data points one by one, so as to minimize an estimate of the error that results by the removal of a point from the current set of points (this estimate is termed \"anticipated error\"). The thinning process generates subsets of \"most significant\" points, such that the piecewise linear interpolants over the Delaunay triangulations of these subsets approximate progressively the function values sampled at the original scattered points, and such that the approximation errors are small relative to the number of points in the subsets. We design various methods for computing the anticipated error at reasonable cost, and compare and test the performance of the methods.

The principle is derived by alternately applying a fundamental property of classical signals and a fundamental property of quantum ones. The principle can be cast into a simple form by using a decomposition of the relevant Hilbert space, which is uniquely determined by the set of possible states. The decomposition implies the classification of the degrees of freedom of the system into three parts depending on how they store the information on the initially chosen state: one storing it classically, one storing it nonclassically, and the other one storing no information. Then the principle states that the nonclassical part is inaccessible and the classical part is read-only if we are to preserve the state of the system. From this principle, many types of no-cloning, no-broadcasting, and no-imprinting conditions can easily be derived in general forms including mixed states.

The GPD is compared to singular value decomposition (SVD) using a common threshold for the singular values, and to SVD using a threshold optimized according to the noise level in each voxel. The comparison is carried out using artificial data as well as data from healthy volunteers. It is shown that GPD is comparable to SVD with a variable optimized threshold when determining the maximum of the IRF, which is directly related to the perfusion. GPD provides a better estimate of the entire IRF. As the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases or the time resolution of the measurements increases, GPD is shown to be superior to SVD.

Our aim in this study is to develop a method for on-line verification of leaf trajectories using an electronic portal imaging device with scanning read-out, independent of the multileaf collimator. Examples of such scanning imagers are electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) based on liquid-filled ionization chambers and those based on amorphous silicon. Portal images were acquired continuously with a liquid-filled ionization chamber EPID during the delivery, together with the signal of treatment progress that is generated by the accelerator. For each portal image, the prescribed leaf and diaphragm positions were computed from the dynamic prescription and the progress information. Motion distortion effects of the leaves are corrected based on the treatment progress that is recorded for each image row. The aperture formed by the prescribed leaves and diaphragms is used as the reference field edge, while the actual field edge is found using a maximum-gradient edge detector. The errors in leaf and diaphragm position are found from the deviations between the reference field edge and the detected field edge. Earlier measurements of the dynamic EPID response show that the accuracy of the detected field edge is better than 1 mm. To ensure that the verification is independent of inaccuracies in the acquired progress signal, the signal was checked with diode measurements beforehand. The method was tested on three different dynamic prescriptions. Using the described method, we correctly reproduced the distorted field edges. Verifying a single portal image took 0.1 s on an 866 MHz personal computer. Two flaws in the control system of our experimental dynamic multileaf collimator were correctly revealed with our method. First, the errors in leaf position increase with leaf speed, indicating a delay of approximately 0.8 s in the control system. Second, the accuracy of the leaves and diaphragms depends on the direction of motion.

These results are important because the judgments of staff auditors often determine the type and extent of documentation in audit workpapers and serve as preliminary inputs for senior auditors' judgments and choices.

This contrasts traditional audio coding where both are integrated within the same subband decomposition. The separation allows for the independent optimization of the irrelevance and redundancy reduction units. For both reductions, we rely on adaptive filtering and predictive coding as much as possible to minimize the delay. A psycho-acoustically controlled adaptive linear filter is used for the irrelevance reduction, and the redundancy reduction is carried out by a predictive lossless coding scheme, which is termed weighted cascaded least mean squared (WCLMS) method.

Our in-house IMRT system has been modified to include the calculation of the deliverable intensity into the optimizer. In this process, prior to dose calculation, the MLC leaf sequencer is used to convert intensities to dynamic MLC sequences, from which the deliverable intensities are then determined. All other optimization steps remain the same. To evaluate the effectiveness of deliverable-based optimization, 17 patient cases have been studied. Compared with standard optimization plus conversion to deliverable beams, deliverable-based optimization results show improved isodose coverage and a reduced dose to critical structures.

The resulting mosaic represents the spectrum at each scene point. The image acquisition is as easy as in traditional image mosaics. We derive an efficient scene sampling rate, and use a registration method that accommodates the spatially varying properties of the filter. Using the data acquired by this method, we demonstrate scene rendering under different simulated illumination spectra. We are also able to infer information about the scene illumination.

Early studies focused on the fanout, convergence, thresholding, and learned weighting of perceptual-motor signals within the cerebellar cortex.

The new model combines the local frequency-band information based on the union of random events, to reduce the dependence of the model on information about the noise. This model partially accomplishes the target: offering robustness to partial frequency-band corruption, while requiring no information about the noise. This paper introduces the theory and implementation of the union model, and is focused on several important advances. These new developments include a new algorithm for automatic order selection, a generalization of the modeling principle to accommodate partial feature stream corruption, and a combination of the union model with conventional noise reduction techniques to deal with a mixture of stationary noise and unknown, nonstationary noise. For the evaluation, we used the TIDIGITS database for speaker-independent connected digit recognition. The utterances were corrupted by various types of additive noise, stationary or time-varying, assuming no knowledge about the noise characteristics.

The goal of the paper is to develop a formal model comprising representations of the cadastre and of reality that allows the simulation and investigation of cases where this correspondence is potentially violated. For this purpose the model consists of two parts, the first part represents the valid legal situation and the second part represents the cadastre. This makes it feasible to mark the differences between reality and the cadastre. The marking together with the two parts of the model facilitate the discussion of issues in \"real-world\" cadastral systems where incorrectness occurs.

The basic assumption in this ontology is that approximate reason is a capability of an agent. Agents are designed to classify information granules derived from sensors that respond to stimuli in the environment of an agent or received from other agents. Classification of information granules is carried out in the context of parameterized approximation spaces and a calculus of granules. Judgment in agents is a faculty of thinking about (classifying) the particular relative to decision rules derived from data. Judgment in agents is reflective, but not in the classical philosophical sense (e.g., the notion of judgment in Kant). In an agent, a reflective judgment itself is an assertion that a particular decision rule derived from data is applicable to an object (input). That is, a reflective judgment by an agent is an assertion that a particular vector of attribute (sensor) values matches to some degree the conditions for a particular rule. In effect, this form of judgment is an assertion that a vector of sensor values reflects a known property of data expressed by a decision rule. Since the reasoning underlying a reflective judgment is inductive and surjective (not based on a priori conditions or universals), this form of judgment is reflective, but not in the sense of Kant. Unlike Kant, a reflective judgment is surjective in the sense that it maps experimental attribute values onto the most closely matching descriptors (conditions) in a derived rule. Again, unlike Kant's notion of judgment, a reflective judgment is not the result of searching for a universal that pertains to a particular set of values of descriptors. Rather, a reflective judgment by an agent is a form of recognition that a particular vector of sensor values pertains to a particular rule in some degree. This recognition takes the form of an assertion that a particular descriptor vector is associated with a particular decision rule. These considerations can be repeated for other forms of classifiers besides those defined by decision rules", "keywords": ["ontology", "approximate reason", "information granules", "parameterized approximation spaces", "granules", "decision rules", "reflective judgment"]}, "626": {"abstract": "Constructing a confidence interval for a binomial proportion or the difference of two proportions is a routine exercise in daily data analysis.

This may be the case when the signals from the various channels are allowed to be strongly positively or negatively correlated. We propose and analyze a general formula for tracking the (time-dependent) correlation between two signals. Some special cases of this formula lead to classical results known from the literature, others are new. This formula is recursive in nature, and uses only the instantaneous values of the two signals, in a low-cost and low-complexity manner; in particular, there is no need to take square roots or to carry out divisions. Furthermore, this formula can be modified with respect to the occurrence of the two signals so as to further decrease the complexity, and increase ease of implementation. The latter modification comes at the expense that not the actual correlation is tracked, but, rather, a somewhat deformed version of it. To overcome this problem, we propose, for a number of instances of the tracking formula, a simple warping operation on the deformed correlation. Now we obtain, at least for sinusoidal signals, the correct value of the correlation coefficient. Special attention is paid to the convergence behavior of the algorithm for stationary signals and the dynamic behavior if there is a transition to another stationary state; the latter is considered to be important to study the tracking abilities to nonstationary signals.

We explore an alternative architecture that we term end system multicast, where end systems implement all multicast related functionality including membership management and packet replication. This shifting of multicast support from routers to end systems has the potential to address most problems associated with IP multicast.

Further, end systems attempt to optimize the efficiency of the overlay by adapting to network dynamics and by considering application level performance.

An important aspect of portable performance is the behavior of the available HPF compilers. Ideally, a programmer may expect comparable performance between different HPF compilers, given the same program and the same machine. To test the performance portability between compilers, we have designed a special benchmark suite, called the TNO HPF benchmark suite. It consists of a set of HPF programs that test various aspects of efficient parallel code generation. The benchmark suite consists of a number of template programs that are used to generate test programs with different array sizes, alignments, distributions, and iteration spaces. It ranges from very simple assignments to more complex assignments such as triangular iteration spaces, convex iteration spaces, coupled subscripts, and indirection arrays. We have run the TNO HPF benchmark suite on three compilers: the PREPARE prototype compiler, the PGI-HPF compiler, and the GMD Adaptor HPF compiler. Results show performance differences that can be quite large (up to two orders of magnitude for the same test program). Closer inspection reveals that the origin of most of the differences in performance is due to differences in local enumeration and storage of distributed array elements"}, "720": {"abstract": "Upgrade your monitor from as little as Pounds 135.

The Bairstow method is introduced to find the roots of a characteristic equation for estimations of multi-modal frequencies, and the computational efficiency of the Bairstow method is shown quantitatively.

Therefore an optimization problem is defined to minimize the maximum inward suspension deflection subject to constraints on the chassis acceleration for three typical road undulations. The optimization problem is solved using sequential linear programming (SLP) and multibody dynamics simulation software. Several optimization runs have been carried out for a small two degree of freedom vehicle model and a large full-scale model of the truck semi-trailer combination. The results show that the stroke dependent damping can reduce large deflections at incidental road disturbances, but that the optimum stroke dependent damping curve is related to the acceleration bound.

Second, frequent discrete signal restoration of the analog information prevents analog noise and offset from degrading the computation. Third, a state machine enables complex computations to be created using a sequence of elementary computations. A natural choice for implementing this hybrid scheme is one based on spikes because spike-count codes are digital, while spike-time codes are analog. We illustrate how spikes afford easy ways to implement all three components of scalable hybrid computation. First, as an important example of distributed analog computation, we show how spikes can create a distributed modular representation of an analog number by implementing digital carry interactions between spiking analog neurons. Second, we show how signal restoration may be performed by recursive spike-count quantization of spike-time codes. Third, we use spikes from an analog dynamical system to trigger state transitions in a digital dynamical system, which reconfigures the analog dynamical system using a binary control vector; such feedback interactions between analog and digital dynamical systems create a hybrid state machine (HSM).

From a forecasting viewpoint, this corresponds to an updating of the initial conditions. The standard forecasting procedure is to then run the model uncorrected into the future, driven by predicted boundary and forcing conditions. The problem with this methodology is that the updated initial conditions quickly 'wash-out', thus, after a certain forecast horizon the model predictions are no better than from an initially uncorrected model. This study demonstrates that through the assimilation of error forecasts (in the present case made using so-called local models) entire model domains can be corrected for extended forecast horizons (i.e. long after updated initial conditions have become washed-out), thus demonstrating significant improvements over the conventional methodology. Some alternate uses of local models are also explored for the re-distribution of error forecasts over the entire model domain, which are then compared with more conventional Kalman filter type schemes"}, "1240": {"keywords": ["HPF/SX V2", "vector parallel machines", "benchmark", "parallelization", "compiler"], "abstract": "We are developing HPF/SX V2, a High Performance Fortran (HPF) compiler for vector parallel machines.

A disadvantage of using a Delaunay triangulation is that the mapping of the overlay to the network topology at the network and data link layer may be suboptimal.

An efficient deadlock-free scheduling algorithm was developed, using timed Petri nets, for a class of FMSs called Systems of Sequential Systems with Shared Resources (S/sup 4/ R). The algorithm generates a partial reachability graph to find the optimal or near-optimal deadlock-free schedule in terms of the firing sequence of the transitions of the Petri net model. The objective is to minimize the mean flow time (MFT). An efficient truncation technique, based on the siphon concept, has been developed and used to generate the minimum necessary portion of the reachability graph to be searched. It has been shown experimentally that the developed siphon truncation technique enhances the ability to develop deadlock-free schedules of systems with a high number of deadlocks, which cannot be achieved using standard Petri net scheduling approaches. It may be necessary, in some cases, to relax the optimality condition for large FMSs in order to make the search effort reasonable. Hence, a User Control Factor (UCF) was defined and used in the scheduling algorithm. The objective of using the UCF is to achieve an acceptable trade-off between the solution quality and the search effort. Its effect on the MFT and the CPU time has been investigated.

Along with the increase of market potential, the need arises for the protection of the image products. Such a need is a very crucial one, because the Internet and other public/private networks have become preferred means of data exchange. A critical issue arising when dealing with digital image distribution is copyright protection. Such a problem has been largely addressed by resorting to watermarking technology. A question that obviously arises is whether the requirements imposed by remote sensing imagery are compatible with existing watermarking techniques. On the basis of these motivations, the contribution of this work is twofold: assessment of the requirements imposed by remote sensing applications on watermark-based copyright protection, and modification of two well-established digital watermarking techniques to meet such constraints. More specifically, the concept of near-lossless watermarking is introduced and two possible algorithms matching such a requirement are presented. Experimental results are shown to measure the impact of watermark introduction on a typical remote sensing application, i.e., unsupervised image classification"}, "1670": {"keywords": ["integrated optimization model", "train crew management", "duty timetable", "rail transport organization", "roster planning horizon", "crew scheduling", "crew rostering", "cyclic rosters", "scheduling"], "abstract": "Train crew management involves the development of a duty timetable for each of the drivers (crew) to cover a given train timetable in a rail transport organization.

The accuracy was limited by the inability to model soft bodies, the inherent difficulties in modeling a statically indeterminate system, and the computing time. Nevertheless, it was found to be useful in investigating the effect of eight design alterations on the lateral stability of the wheelchair. Stability was quantified by determining the static lateral stability angles and the maximum height of a road curb over which the wheelchair could successfully drive on a diagonal heading.

The payoff functions which we derive provide a number of insights about the risk structure of company cross-holdings. First, the Modigliani-Miller theorem can obtain when there exist cross-holdings between firms. Second, by establishing cross-shareholdings each of stock holders distributes a part of its payoff values to the bond holder of the other's firm, so that both firms can decrease credit risks by cross-shareholdings. In the numerical examples, we show that the correlation in firms can be a critical condition for reducing credit risk by cross-holdings of stock using Monte Carlo simulation.

There are two risks in the use of high-speed milling on hardened steels. One of these is tool breakage, which may be very costly and may furthermore entail marks on the workpiece. The other is collisions between the tool and the workpiece or fixtures, the result of which may be damage to the ceramic bearings in the spindles. in order to minimize these risks it is necessary that new control and optimization steps be included in the CAM methodology. There are three things that the firm adopting high-speed methods should do. It should redefine its process engineering, it should systematize access by its CAM programmers to high-speed knowhow, and it should take up the use of process simulation tools. In the latter case, it will be very advantageous to use tools for the estimation of cutting forces. The new work methods proposed in this article have made it possible to introduce high speed milling (HSM) into the die industry.

Ten features represented each case: calcification distribution, calcification morphology, calcification number, mass margin, mass shape, mass density, mass size, associated findings, special cases, and age. Performance was evaluated using Round Robin sampling, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, and bootstrap. To determine the most influential features for the CBR, an exhaustive feature search was performed over all possible feature combinations (1022) and similarity thresholds.

Materials Methods: The reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position is estimated by quantification of tissue shifts in the breasts of healthy volunteers between repeat MR setups. For each volunteer fiducials are identified and registered with their counter locations in corresponding MR volumes. The difference in position denotes the shift of breast tissue. The dependence on breast volume and the part of the breast, as well as the effect of a breast immobilization cast are studied. Results: The tissue shifts are small with a mean standard deviation on the order of 1.5 mm, being slightly larger in large breasts (V>1000 cm/sup 3/), and in the posterior part (toward the pectoral muscle) of both small and large breasts. The application of a breast immobilization cast reduces the tissue shifts in large breasts.

In particular, we study a two-stage flow shop, in which the batch stage is succeeded by a serial stage. The serial stage may be realized by a single machine or by parallel machines. Through an extensive simulation study it is demonstrated how shop performance can be improved by the proposed strategy relative to existing strategies", "keywords": ["flow shops", "manufacturing operations", "production systems", "ovens", "aircraft industry", "semiconductor manufacturing", "dynamic scheduling", "multi-stage flow shops", "control strategies", "integral scheduling approach", "shop optimization", "look-ahead strategy", "near-future arrivals", "two-stage flow shop", "single machine", "parallel machines", "simulation study"]}, "1198": {"keywords": ["Runge-Kutta methods", "numerical approximation", "order of convergence", "projected methods", "index-2 differential-algebraic equations"], "abstract": "A new projection technique for Runge-Kutta methods applied to index-2 differential-algebraic equations is presented in which the numerical approximation is projected only as part of the output process.

To gain some intuition on this problem, we studied the firing times of two simple integrate-and-fire model neurons driven by a correlated binary variable that represents the total input current. Analytic expressions were obtained for the average firing rate and coefficient of variation (a measure of spike-train variability) as functions of the mean, variance, and correlation time of the stochastic input. The results of computer simulations were in excellent agreement with these expressions. In these models, an increase in correlation time in general produces an increase in both the average firing rate and the variability of the output spike trains. However, the magnitude of the changes depends differentially on the relative values of the input mean and variance: the increase in firing rate is higher when the variance is large relative to the mean, whereas the increase in variability is higher when the variance is relatively small. In addition, the firing rate always tends to a finite limit value as the correlation time increases toward infinity, whereas the coefficient of variation typically diverges.

Even in such a case, the load shared by each lamina in the laminate cannot be correctly determined if the lamina instantaneous stiffness matrix is inaccurately provided, since the lamina is always statically indeterminate in the laminate.

A generalized form of the Black-Scholes (BS) partial differential equation (1973) and some closed-form solutions are obtained. The standard BS equation (q = 1) which is used by economists to calculate option prices requires multiple values of the stock volatility (known as the volatility smile). Using q = 1.5 which well models the empirical distribution of returns, we get a good description of option prices using a single volatility", "keywords": ["fluctuations", "financial instruments", "nonextensive thermodynamics parameter", "closed-form solutions", "stock volatility", "volatility smile", "empirical distribution"]}, "904": {"abstract": "This article presents a modeling and simulation methodology to analyze the performance of voice quality when sent over the available bit rate service in asynchronous transfer mode networks. Sources can modify the rate at which they send traffic to the network based on the feedback carried in the resource management cells. This is achieved by changing the encoding level. As the contention increases to network resources-bandwidth in this case-sources start reducing the rate at which they generate and send traffic. The efficiency of the scheme under different scheduling/drop policies and other operating conditions and environments is evaluated using simulation modeling. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is applied to different parameters, such as queue size and averaging interval length, to investigate their impact on the performance metrics. Results show that limiting the load to 41% of the link capacity results in an acceptable quality", "keywords": ["simulation", "modeling", "voice quality", "traffic", "feedback", "resource management cells", "encoding level", "scheduling/drop policies", "queue size", "averaging interval length", "performance metrics", "link capacity", "asynchronous transfer mode"]}, "1753": {"keywords": ["probability", "risk theory", "nonlinear dividend barrier", "surplus process", "probability of survival", "discounted dividend payments", "numerical illustrations", "exponential claim sizes", "parabolic dividend barrier"], "abstract": "In the framework of classical risk theory we investigate a surplus process in the presence of a nonlinear dividend barrier and derive equations for two characteristics of such a process, the probability of survival and the expected sum of discounted dividend payments.
